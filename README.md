# Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This is an ongoing self-learning repository of reinforcement learning. My curret goal is to make a result that I can be happy with from OpenAI Gym Atari Space Invaders environment. Usually I'm working on during weekend when I have time.

## Results

## Algorithms

* Deep Q Network (DQN)
* Dueling architecture
* Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)
* Prioritized experience replay (PER)

## Tools

* Google Colab
* AWS EC2 Ubuntu 18.04 g4dn.xlarge 1GPU
  * Set up Jupyter Lab and run Jupyter Notebooks
* AWS Deep Learning AMI 1GPU

## Studying approach

* Reinforcement Learning An Introduction, Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto
* Coursera Reinforcement Learning Specialization by University of Alberta (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)
* Reading papers from OpenAI Spinning Up key papers (https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html)
* Reading blogs.
