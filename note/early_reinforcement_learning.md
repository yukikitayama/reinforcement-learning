# Early Reinforcement Learning

## Trial-and-error learning

R. S. Woodworth, Alexander Bain, Conway Lloyd Morgan, Edward Thorndike

Law of E ffect.

Pavlov reinforcement, a reinforcer, a stimulus that an animal receives.

Thomas Ross, W. Grey Walter, 

**Learning automata**

**Stochastic learning automata**

**Classifier system**

**Genetic algorithm**

## Optimal control

Controller to minimize or maximize a measure of a dynamic system's behavior over time.

Developed in 1950s, by Richard Bellman

Use a dynamical system's state, value function, optimal return function

Use dynamic programming, which is method for solving optimal control problems.

Introduced Markov Decision Processes.

## Temporal-difference learning

**Secondary reinforcers** a stimulus that has been paired with a primary reinforcer such as food or pain

**Actor-critic architecture** a method for using temporal-difference learning combined with trial-and-error learning.
